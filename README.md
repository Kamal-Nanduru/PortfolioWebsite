# Portfolio App
Basic Portfolio app done by using Reactjs & Web Technologies
As we are using ReactJs, we have separated everything into various components in this project, and we have applied CSS to each component separately! In this project, we employed two new external dependencies: EmailJs, which is used to receive email from users, and swiperjs, which is used to build contemporary touch sliders with hardware-accelerated transitions. Also, we employ the UseRef hook in addition to the UseState hook. and we employ core CSS to provide better results; hopefully, I've covered all the key elements used in this project!
